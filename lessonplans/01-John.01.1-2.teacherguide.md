<h1>Teacher's Guide for Lesson One: John 1:1-2</h1>

1. <strong>Language Objectives</strong>:
  Using single-words or short phrases drawn from the text, students will respond appropriately in Greek to basic questions posed in Greek using ἢ (e.g. ἀρχῇ ἢ τελευτή;) and τίς (e.g. τίς ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ;) An activity to teach this: ask each student Τίς ει; or Συ τίς ει; After names are established, point to someone and give two names, e.g. Ἰωνάθαν ἢ Μιχαήλ; or τίς ἐστίν; Ἰωνάθαν ἢ Μιχαήλ;
1. <strong>Exposure</strong>:
  Students are exposed to the following skills, but not yet given enough practice to master them: questions using πρὸς τίνα (e.g. πρὸς τίνα ἦν ὁ λόγος ἐν ἀρχῇ;), questions using πότε (e.g. πότε ἦν ὁ λόγος πρὸς τὸν θεόν;), reading and writing the alphabet for letters used in the text, pronunciation of these words.
  Students are exposed to this part of the alphabet: α-γ-ε-ηθ-κλ-ν-οπρστ--χ--, -------Θ--Λ---Ο---------. They are exposed to breathing: ἐν, ὁ, ἦν, Οὗτος; dipthongs: καὶ, Οὗτος; and punctuation: ",", ".", and ";".
1. <strong>Note</strong>: Vocabulary, syntax, and grammatical forms will be tracked automatically for these lessons, and not called out under exposure (after this one mention).

1. <strong>Procedure</strong>
    1. <strong>Introduce the lesson objectives</strong> using slides 1.1 and 1.2 from <em>01-John.01.1-13.html</em>. Say the Greek words aloud, and have the students repeat them. Tell them a key aspect of their learning will come through repeating what they hear. Agree on a hand signal to indicate when students should repeat what they have heard.
