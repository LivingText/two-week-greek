<h1>Teacher's Guide for Lesson One: John 1:1-2</h1>

1. <strong>Language Objectives</strong>:
  Using single-words or short phrases drawn from the text, students will respond appropriately in Greek to basic questions posed in Greek using ἢ (e.g. ἀρχῇ ἢ τελευτή;) and τίς (e.g. τίς ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ;) An activity to teach this: ask each student Τίς ει; or Συ τίς ει; After names are established, point to someone and give two names, e.g. Ἰωνάθαν ἢ Μιχαήλ; or τίς ἐστίν; Ἰωνάθαν ἢ Μιχαήλ;
  
1. <strong>Exposure</strong>:
  Students are exposed to the following skills, but not yet given enough practice to master them: questions using πρὸς τίνα (e.g. πρὸς τίνα ἦν ὁ λόγος ἐν ἀρχῇ;), questions using πότε (e.g. πότε ἦν ὁ λόγος πρὸς τὸν θεόν;), reading and writing the alphabet for letters used in the text, pronunciation of these words.
  Students are exposed to this part of the alphabet: α-γ-ε-ηθ-κλ-ν-οπρστ--χ--, -------Θ--Λ---Ο---------. They are exposed to breathing: ἐν, ὁ, ἦν, Οὗτος; dipthongs: καὶ, Οὗτος; and punctuation: ",", ".", and ";".
  
1. <strong>Note</strong>: Vocabulary, syntax, and grammatical forms will be tracked automatically for these lessons, and not called out under exposure (after this one mention).

1. <strong>Resources to have on hand for an optional exercise  using slide 1.9</strong>
    1. a cup (τὸ ποτήριον, τοῦ ποτήριου)
    1. a ball small enough to fit in the cup (ἡ σφαῖρα, τῆς σφαίρας)
    1. a table (ἡ τράπεζα, τῆς τραπέζας)
    [Note: The students will not need to learn these Greek words, but they will hear you say them class if you decid to use this exercise.]

<h2>Language Mini-Lesson: Asking and Answering Questions</h2>

1. <strong>Introduce the lesson objectives</strong> using slides 1.1 and 1.2 from <em>01-John.01.1-13.html</em>. Say the Greek words aloud, and have the students repeat them. Tell them that a key aspect of their learning will come through repeating what they hear. Agree on a hand signal to indicate when students should repeat what they have heard.
    
1. <strong>Slide 1.3</strong> introduces the Greek words ναί and οὔ with hand emojis. Have the students make the sign and say the words aloud.

1. <strong>Slide 1.4</strong> reviews these words without the emojis. Have the students say the words and make the appropriat hand gesture.
    Clicking the spacebar with add the emoji back to confirm student responses.
1. <strong>Slides 1.5 — 1.8</strong> reverse this procedure, displaying the emoji and expecting the students to supply the word. When you click the spacebar, the word will be added.

1. <strong>Slide 1.9</strong> introduces ἤ. Say the word and use your agreed upon hand signal to prompt the students to repeat it.
    <stong>Optional Exercise</stong>
      Pick up the cup you brought and say slowly ποτήριον, ποτήριον. Invite the students to repeat the word, then assure them (in English: "You will not need to know this word after today. Just practice saying in for now.").
      Sit the cup down and pick up the ball. Say slowly: "σφαῖρα, σφαῖρα." Have the students repeat the word. 
      Place both the ποτήριον and the σφαῖρα on the table (ἐπὶ τῆς τραπέζας). Look at them thoughfully as if considerting which one to pick up. Pause. Pick up the ball. Ask, σφαῖρα ἤ ποτήριον; (As you ask the question, point to the word ἤ on the screen.) Repeat the question. Students should respond: σφαῖρα.
      Use ναὶ to confirm correct answers or οὒ to gently challenge incorrect ones (ναί, σφαῖρα - with a big smile, or οὔ - with a thoughtful expression).
      Repeat with the cup (τὸ ποτήριον).

1. <strong>Slide 1.10</strong> has the thumbs up emoji with the question ναὶ ἢ οὔ;. Ask the question and point to the emoji. Students should respond ναί. If they do not, supply the answer yourself and repeat the question. Clicking the spacebar will reveal the answer.
      
1. <strong>Slide 1.11</strong> does the same thing with the thumbs down emoji.

1. Use <strong>slides 1.12 and 1.13</strong> to introduce the names Μαρία and Ἰωάνης. These names will be used a lot in this course. Have the students repeat each one more than once.

1. <strong>Slide 1.14</strong> introduces the question word τίς;. Say the word with a questioning look on your face. Repeat it once or twice, but without explanation, then advance to the next slide.

1. <strong>Slides 1.15 and 1.16</strong> show a male or female emoji and present the question, Μαρία ἢ Ἰωάνης;. Ask the question and invite the students to answer it. Clicking the spacebar reveals the answer on each slide.

1. <strong>Slides 1.17 and 1.18</strong> ask about the emojis without provideing the names. They only ask τίς; Students should supply the names. Clicking the spacebar will reveal the expected response.
      
  <h2>Guided Reading Passage: John 1:1-2</h2>
      
Pressing the spacebar or the right arrow will now move you to the beginning of the guided reading portion of the lesson (<strong>slide 2.1</strong>). This slide provides the biblical citation in both English and Greek. Explain in English that we are about to begin reading John 1:1-2. Reasure the students that while they will not understand at first, the <em>will</em> understand by the end of the lesson.

Read the citation in English, then read it very slowly in Greek.
  
<h3>Pronouncing the Text</h3>
  
1. Clicking the spacebar or the down arrow will take you to <strong>slide 2.2</strong>. The slide appears blank. Explain in English: "I am going to display the passage a little at a time.

  τὸν
  θεόν
  καὶ ὁ λόγος

  Now read the entire phrase slowly and have the students repeat it:

      Point to the first picture and say ἡ ἀρχή. 
      Cup your hands as if holding the seeds. 
      Begin to take one at a time and "plant" them. 
      Pantomime a plant growing.

1. <strong>Slide 3.12</strong> displays the word ἦν and equates it with the English word "was." 
      This is not a strategy we would use if the point were to teach the students to recognize ἦν in other contexts. Since that is not the focus of this lesson, however, we will keep the focus on the other words by simply supplying the English for this one. 
   
1. <strong>Slide 3.13</strong> repeats the clause: Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος with the word ἦν highlighted in blue. Read the clause aloud, then point to the word ἦν and read it aloud.

      Point to any word in the graphic and say λόγος ἕν (holding up one finger). 
      Point to another word and say λόγος δύο (holding up two fingers). 
      Point to a third word and say λόγος τρεῖς (holding up three fingers), then to fourth one saying λόγος τέσσαρες (holding up four fingers).

   Tap the spacebar again to display the second clause:

      If no response is forthcoming, read the clause again, but emphsize the words ὁ λόγος:
