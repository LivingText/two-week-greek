<h2>Language Mini-Lesson: Pronouns</h2>

1. <strong>Slide 1.1</strong> is the title page. Each lesson in this course begins with a section entitled "Language." Leave this slide displayed as students arrive.

1. <strong>Slide 1.2</strong> displays the phrases that will be the target of this lesson. It is not necessary that the students understand them now. They simply need to hear them, say them, and understand that they will be the focus of today's lesson. Feel free to tell them that in English.
Read each phrase aloud and have the students repeat it. Do this more than once.

    * ἐγὼ εἰμι
    * σὺ εἶ
    * αὐτὸς ἐστιν
    * αὐτὴ ἐστιν

1. <strong>Slide 1.3</strong> display's the phrase ἐγὼ εἰμί a man (Jonathan) pointing to himself. Point to yourself and say, ἐγὼ εἰμί [your name].

1. <strong>Slide 1.4</strong> shows a little girl pointing directly at the camara. Point to a student whos name you know. Say σὺ εἶ [the student's name]. Repeat this with other students if you know their names. If not, approach a student, point to him or her, and <i>ask</i>, σὺ εἶ; The student should say his or her name.

1. <strong>Slide 1.5</strong> displays the phrase αὐτός ἐστιν and shows a baseball player. We see the hand of someone off camara pointing to him. 
Point to a male student and say to the rest of the class αὐτός ἐστιν [student's name]. Repeat this with other students if you can. For a student whose name you do not know, point to the student and ask, αὐτός ἐστιν; The students should supply the name of the student you indicate.
<em>If there are no male students in your class</em>, point to the man in the picture and say, αὐτός ἐστιν Eddie. 
[Eddie Grant was a third baseman for the Cincinnati Reds.]

1. <strong>Slide 1.6</strong> displays the phrase αὐτή ἐστιν and shows two young girls pointing to each other. Point to a female student whose name you know and say αὐτή ἐστιν [student's name]. 
<em>If there are no female students in your class</em>, point to the girl with the striped shirt in the picture and say αὐτή ἐστιν Μειλίν. [We don't actually know her name, but that's not relevant. The point is to teach the meaning of αὐτή ἐστιν.]

<h3>Questions</h3>

1. <strong>Slide 1.7</strong> presents the statment ἐγὼ εἰμὶ ᾿Ιωνάθαν followed by three questions. Point to the statement and read it aloud: ἐγὼ εἰμὶ ᾿Ιωνάθαν. Have the students repeat it. 

1. Face the class, point to yourself, and say ἐγὼ εἰμι [your name].

1. Approach a student and say, καὶ σύ, τίς εἶ; If necessary, point out the words on the screen and repeat the question to the student. The student should supply her or his name. If not, point to the student and ask someone nearby τίς ἐστιν; When the correct name is given, repeat it, then ask the original student again: τίς εἶ; Ask the same question to a few more students.

1. Point to a male student and ask the rest of the class, καὶ αὐτός, τίς ἐστιν; The students should reply with the appropriate name. Repeat this with a few more male students.

1. Point to a female student and ask the rest of the class, καὶ αὐτή, τίς ἐστιν; They should respond with the appropriate name.

1. <strong>Slide 1.8</strong> introduces case forms, but it is not necessary to talk about the issue of grammatical case explicitly. The ojective is to help students see that the form of a noun changes depending on its context.

1. Point to the title (πρὸς τίνα) and read it aloud. Have the students repeat it.

1. The slide shows a table with two columns. The column headers are τίς; and πρὸς τίνα; Point to them and read them aloud.

1. Point to τίς; and read it aloud with a look of questioning. Pause, then answer your question by pointing to ὁ θεός and reading it aloud with a look of accomplishment.

1. Point to πρὸς τίνα; Read the question aloud with a look of questioning, then answer your question by pointing to πρὸς τὸν θεόν and reading it aloud.

1. Repeat this same procedure with each of the other rows in the table.

1. <strong>Slide 1.9</strong> repeats the accusative case forms of the pronouns from the previous slide with πρός. 

    * πρός με
    * πρός σε
    * πρὸς αὐτόν
    * πρὸς αὐτήν

1. Read the first line (πρός με) and have the students repeat it.

1. Look at a student and say ἐλθὲ πρός με (motioning for the student to approach you). When the student arrives, look at the class and say [the student's name] ἐστι <em>πρὸς με</em>. Smile at the student who came and motion toward his or her seat. Repeat this demonstration with at least two more students.

1. Point to the second line on the slide and read aloud: πρός <em>σε</em>. Invite the students to repeat it.

1. Walk to one student. Look at the student and say εἰμὶ <em>πρός σε</em>. Repeat the statement putting your hand on your own chest when you say εἰμί, and pointing to the student when you say πρός σε. Walk to a different student and do the same. Do this with three or four students.

1. Point to the third line on the slide. Read aloud: πρὸς αὐτόν. Have the students repeat it. 
Point to the last line and read it aloud: πρὸς αὐτήν. Have the students repeat it.

1. Walk to one student, but point to a different student, and say ἐλθὲ πρὸς αὐτόν (if the student to who you are pointing is male) or ἐλθὲ πρὸς αὐτήν (if she is female). If the student in front of you walks to the one to whom you pointed, look delighted and say καλόν! Repeat this with at least two more students.

1. <strong>Slide 1.10</strong> repeats the same four phrases, but adds two phrases with nouns: 

    * πρὸς τὸν θεόν and 
    * πρὸς τὸν λόγον. 

1. Read each of these phrases aloud and have the students repeat it.

1. <strong>Slides 1:11 - 1.22</strong> each present a numinative case pronoun or noun, then under it shows the preposition πρός. On each slide you will read the nominative case form, and the students will respond with πρός and the accusative case form. To teach them how to do this, guide them through the first one (<strong>Slide 1:11</strong>) as follows:

1. <strong>Slides 1:11</strong>: Read the noun phrase: ὁ θεός with a confident voice. Read πρὸς... as if you don't know what should follow it. Look uncertain to try to elicit a response from one of the students. If no one responds, reread ὁ θεός with a confident voice, then point to πρὸς and with a cautious voice say πρὸς... τὸν θεόν. Quickly repeat it with confidence: πρὸς τὸν θεόν!

1. With <strong>Slides 1:12 - 1.22</strong> the students should understand what to do. If they still seem confused, work through slide 1.12 the same was as you did with 1.11.

<h2>Guided Reading: Κατά Ιωάννην 1:3-4</h2>

<h3>Pronunciation Practice</h3>

1. <strong>Slide 2.1</strong> gives the biblical citation of the passage you will read. John 1:3-4/Κατά Ιωάννην 1:3-4. Read the Greek text aloud and have the students repeat it.

1. <strong>Slide 2.1</strong> appears as a blank screen at first. 
Take a moment to explain in English: 
We are about to read John 1:3-4. You are unlikely to understand much on the first reading. That is not a reason to worry. Just listen to the pronunciation and try our best to repeat it.

1. Tap the spacebar to reveal the first clause: πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο. Read through the clause one word at a time, then in chunks as follows:

    * καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ
    * ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν
    * καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν

1. Tap the spacebar to reveal the third clause: ὃ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἦν. Follow the same procedure as with the previous clauses:

    * ὃ
    * γέγονεν
    * ἐν
    * αὐτῷ
    * ζωὴ
    * ἦν
    * ὃ γέγονεν
    * ἐν αὐτῷ
    * ζωὴ ἦν
    * ὃ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ
    * ζωὴ ἦν
    * ὃ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἦν

1. Tap the spacebar one more time to reveal the last clause: καὶ ἡ ζωὴ ἦν τὸ φῶς τῶν ἀνθρώπων. Follow the same procedure as with the other clauses:

    * καὶ
    * ἡ
    * ζωὴ
    * ἦν
    * τὸ
    * φῶς

1. <strong>Slide 3.12</strong> asks the question τίς; and displays the emoji of two people. Read the question and have the students repeat it.

1. <strong>Slide 3.13</strong> repeats the clause πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο. When you press the spacebar the question τίς ἐγένετο
διὰ τοῦ λόγου; appears. Read the question at a moderate to slow pace and wait for a response. This question may take some processing, so be patient!

1. Someone may answer, πάντα. If so, look excited and say ναί. <em>πάντα</em> ἐγένετο διὰ τοῦ λόγου and press the spacebar to reveal the answer. If no one answers, wait several seconds before pressing the spacebar and revealing the answer. When you reveal the answer, read it aloud and have the students repeat it.

<h3>Building Comprehension: καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν</h3>

1. Press the spacebar or the right arrow to go to <strong>section 4</strong> (beginning with <em>slide 4.1</em>). This section begins with a blank screen. 

1. Press the spacebar to review the clause πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο, then press it again to reveal the next clause: καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν. Read the new clause aloud slowly. Have the students repeat.

1. <strong>Slide 5.6</strong> shows the picture of the magician and rabbit again, but now the text contrasts two ways to say the same thing. (Both forms are used in the text we are studying.)

    * ἐγένετο <em>ἐν αὐτῷ</em>
    * ἐγένετο <em>δι’ αὐτοῦ</em>

1. Read each statement and have the students repeat it. Point to the = sign and say ἐγένετο <em>ἐν αὐτῷ</em> καὶ ἐγένετο <em>δι’ αὐτοῦ</em> ἴσός ἐστιν. As you say the word ἴσος encircle the sign with your finger.

1. <strong>Slide 5.10</strong> displays two pictures of a fish: one dead and one alive. Point to the dead fish and say χωρὶς ζωῆς. Point to the live fish and say μετὰ ζωῆς. 

1. For comic relief and to increase retention, you could smile broadly, raise your arms as if dramatically taking in a breath, and say μετὰ ζωῆς. Then fall to the floor, close your eyes and say χωρὶς ζωῆς.

1. <strong>Slide 5.11</strong> shows a dead tree and a live sprout. Point to the dead tree and say χωρὶς ζωῆς. Point to the sprout and say μετὰ ζωῆς.

1. <strong>Slide 5.12</strong> introduces the distinction between τίς for animate characters and τί for inanimate objects. The slide shows two pictures of a young girl (Sofía) with a bicycle. In the first there is a red circle around Sofía and the caption above the picture says τίς. Point to Sofía and ask, τίς; Then answer the question: Σοφία.

1. Point to the bicyle in the second picture. Ask τί; Of course no one is going to know the word for bicycle. Besides, they didn't exist at the time of our text. The Modern Greek word for bicycle is ποδήλατο, and you can use that word if you like, or you could throw up your hands and say οὔ γινώσκω (placing your right fingers on your temple). οὔκ ἦσαν ἐκείνοι.

1. <strong>Slide 5.13</strong> has the same title (τίς; τί;) but only shows one option. Jesus is circled in Leonardo da Vinci's "Last Supper. Ask, τίς; and wait for an answer. Someone may volunteer, "Jesus." If so, congratulate the student saying, ναί. ὁ Ἰησοῦς ἐστιν!

1. <strong>Slide 5.14</strong> shows the same painting, but with the table circled. Ask, τί; and wait a few seconds, then point to the table and say ἡ τραπέζά ἐστιν.

1. <strong>Slide 5.15</strong> returns the focus to the text by repeating the focal clause: ὃ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἦν. Press the spacebar to reveal the question, <em>τί</em> ἦν ὃ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ; Ask the question and wait for a response. Someone may offer, ζωή or ἡ ζωή. If so, congratulate the student saying καλός! ὃ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ <em>ζωὴ</em> ἦν. Press the spacebar to reveal a differently worded version of the answer: <em>ἡ ζωὴ</em> ἦν ὃ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ. Read it aloud and have the students repeat it.

<h3>Building Comprehension: καὶ ἡ ζωὴ ἦν τὸ φῶς τῶν ἀνθρώπων</h3>

1. Pressing the spacebar or clicking the right arrow will take you to <strong>section 6</strong> (<stong>slide 6.1</stong>). As with the other sections, this one begins with a blank slide. Press the spacebar to review the text already discussed one clause at a time. Read each clause aloud and have the students repeat it.

    * πάντα δι’ αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο,
    * καὶ χωρὶς αὐτοῦ ἐγένετο οὐδὲ ἕν.
    * ὃ γέγονεν ἐν αὐτῷ ζωὴ ἦν,

1. Pressing the spacebar one more time will reveil the next focal clause (καὶ ἡ ζωὴ ἦν τὸ φῶς τῶν ἀνθρώπων·) in blue text. Read it aloud and have the students repeat it.

1. <strong>Slide 6.2</strong> repeats the new focal clause: καὶ ἡ ζωὴ ἦν τὸ φῶς τῶν ἀνθρώπων. Press the spacebar to reveal the phrase τὸ φῶς in large print. Read it aloud and have the students repeat it. The next few slides will make its meaning clear.

1. Students may respond, τὸ φῶς or τὸ φῶς τῶν ἀνθρώπων. If they do, congratulate them with καλόν. <em>τὸ φῶς τῶν ἀνθρώπων</em> ἦν ἡ ζωὴ. Tap the spacebar to reveal this answer, and invite the students to repeat it.

1. Pressing the spacebar or clicking the right arrow will take you to <strong>section 7</strong> (<strong>slide 7.1</strong>). The slide has the question κατέλαβες; at the top and a picture of a child looking with confusion at a camara or cellphone. It is not important that the students learn the verb form κατέλαβες at this point. The question means roughly "Do you get it?" or "Do you understand?" It is intended to introduce the review section of the lesson.

1. <strong>Slide 7.2</strong> opens with the first clause from lesson one: Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ λόγος. Read it aloud and invite the students to repeat it. Press the spacebar once for each of the other clauses covered in that first lesson, reading each aloud and inviting the students to repeat.

1. <strong>Slide 7.3</strong> does the same with the clauses from this lesson. Use the same procedure.

1. <strong>Slide 7.4</strong> begins a review of the pronouns we have introduced in this lesson. Point to yourself and say ἐγώ. Point to the space <i>before</i> the word εἰμι on the screen, and say ἐγώ... ἐγὼ εἰμί. Press the spacebar to reveal the pronoun ἐγὼ. Have the students repeat: ἐγὼ εἰμί.

1. <strong>Slide 7.5</strong> repeats the picture of a child pointing directly at the camara. Signal to the space before the verb εἶ. Ask τί λόγος; Wait for a response. If no one offers a response, point to a student and say σύ, then poinit to the space before εἶ and say, σύ εἶ. Press the spacebar to reveal the pronoun. Have the students repeat, σύ εἶ.

1. <strong>Slide 7.6</strong> repeats the picture of the baseball player. Point to the space before the verb ἐστιν, look at the class, and wait for a response. Someone should respond αὐτός or αὐτὸς ἐστιν. If that does not happen within about 15 seconds, say αὐτός...  αὐτὸς ἐστιν. Tap the spacebar to reveal the answer and have the students repeat it.

1. <strong>Slide 7.7</strong> repeats the picture of the two girls pointing at each other. Wait for a response. If no one says αὐτή within about 15 seconds, say it yourself and tap the spacebar to reveal the pronoun. Say αὐτή ἐστιν and have the students repeat it.

1. <strong>Slides 7.8 - 7.13</strong> each present a nominative case pronoun or noun. On each slide press the spacebar to reveal the preposition πρός. On the first one (<strong>slide 7.8</strong>), the text reads ὁ θεός. Press the spacebar to reveal πρός, then say πρὸς τὸν θεόν. Press the spacebar again to reveal τὸν θεόν.

1. On each of the other slides (<strong>7.9 - 7.13</strong>), reveal read the initial text, reveal πρός, and wait for the students to complete the phrase before revealing the rest.

1. As with the first lesson, the Greek question mark (;) appears on the final screen (<strong>7.14</strong>). This signals question and discussion time. Allow students to ask questions in English, but encourage them to use Greek where they can. Your responses should use Greek as much as possible as well, but comprehension in paramount in this section, so do what you must to insure understanding.
