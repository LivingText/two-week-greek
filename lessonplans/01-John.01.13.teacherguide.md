<h1>Teacher's Guide for Lesson Eight: John 1:1-13</h1>

<strong>Language Objectives</strong>:
Using a stone, an envelope or letter, and a cup, students will ask and answer questions using οὗτος, αὕτη, and τοῦτό. These questions are based on the Where Are Your Keys Universal Speed Curriculum.

    * τί ἐστιν τοῦτο;
    * οὗτος ἐστιν ὁ λίθος. 
    * ἐστιν οὗτος ὁ λίθος σου; 
    * αὕτη ἐστιν ἡ ἐπιστολή. 
    * ἐστιν αὔτη ἡ ἐπιστολή σου; 
    * τοῦτό ἐστιν τὸ ποτήριον. 
    * ἐστιν τοῦτο τὸ ποτήριον σου;


After that, we will review John 1:1-13 by:

    * Reading the text
    * Reviewing the standard questions we have been using
    * For each of the 3 sections of text, students will ask and answer questions in groups of 3-4, then in the larger group.

<strong>TPR opportunities</strong>: Once the language objective section has been taught, students should divide into groups of 3-4.  Each group has a stone, an envelope, and a cup. Using these objects, students should ask and answer the above questions, sometimes asking questions that invoke a "yes" answer, sometimes asking questions that invoke a "no" answer.

<strong>Resources</strong>: A stone, cup, and envelope for each group of 3-4 students, plus one for the teacher.
