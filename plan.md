## Overall plan

1. Pick 10 passages - highlight big picture of life of Jesus
2. For each passage, do formatting along the lines in the templates directory
3. For each passage, pick a language objective and a content objective
4. For each passage, fill in scaffolding needed to allow students to answer each question. 
  - show text without explanation
  - add scaffolding 
  - work all 4 channels - listening, speaking, reading, writing
  - rinse and repeat

Create both:  (a) student materials (possibly xhtml presentation, possibly PDF)
(b) teaching guide

Alphabet is taught by (a) pronouncing the words, and (b) handwriting exercises.  At the end of each lesson, a color coded alphabet shows students which letters have already been covered.  Students are given a pronunciation guide and a handwriting guide for review between classes or after the class is finished.

Grammar is taught initially by asking / answering questions that identify the constituents of a clause together with their case markings. Tables of forms are introduced after they are encountered, showing only the rows and columns that have been encountered so far.

Treedowning may be used later in the class.
