## Overall plan

1. Pick 10 passages - highlight big picture of life of Jesus
2. For each passage, do formatting along the lines in the templates directory
3. For each passage, pick a language objective and a content objective
4. For each passage, fill in scaffolding needed to allow students to answer each question. 
  - show text without explanation
  - add scaffolding 
  - work all 4 channels - listening, speaking, reading, writing
  - rinse and repeat

Create both:  (a) student materials (possibly xhtml presentation, possibly PDF)
(b) teaching guide

Early lessons cover 2-3 verses, later lessons may cover as much as an entire passage depending on student progress. The student materials for each lesson explicitly state the language and content objectives.  For instance, for John 1:1-2, the content objective is to respond appropriately in Greek to basic questions posed in Greek using ἢ (e.g. ἀρχῇ ἢ τελευτή; and τίς (e.g. τίς ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ;).  The handout also lists questions that have been asked in this form: ἀρχῇ ἢ τελευτή; τίς ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ; θεὸς ἢ ἄνθρωπος; τίς ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν;  θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος ἢ ἄνθρωπος ἦν ὁ λόγος; τίς ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν θεόν;  The student handout also helps students (and teachers) track their progress by identifying what aspects of the language they have learned so far.  Important:  the handouts must carefully distinguish material they have been exposed to from material we expect them to have mastered so that students are not completely overwhelmed.

The alphabet is taught by (a) pronouncing the words, and (b) handwriting exercises.  At the end of each lesson, a color coded alphabet shows students which letters have already been covered.  Students are given a pronunciation guide and a handwriting guide for review between classes or after the class is finished. Students are given an indication of what they have seen to track progress, but reassured that they don't have to master everything the first time they encounter it, and there will be regular practice with using the alphabet in context and they will pick it up. At first, accents are all lumped into one pot. For instance, here is a guide to the forms encountered in 1 John 1:1-2 that students would receive after that first lesson:

```
αβγδεζηθικλμνξοπρστυφχψω
ΑΒΓΔΕΖΗΘΙΚΛΜΝΞΟΠΡΣΤΥΦΧΨΩ

α-γ-ε-ηθ-κλ-ν-οπρστ--χ--
-------Θ--Λ---Ο---------

Dipthongs: καὶ, Οὗτος
Breathing: ἐν, ὁ, ἦν, Οὗτος
```

Vocabulary and forms are also tracked.  For instance, here are the forms encountered in John 1:1-2, grouped by lemma:

```
ἀρχῇ
ἦν
Ἐν, ἐν
Θεὸς, Θεόν
καὶ
Λόγος
ὁ, τὸν
Οὗτος
πρὸς
```


Grammar is taught initially by asking / answering questions that identify the constituents of a clause together with their case markings. Tables of forms are introduced after they are encountered, showing only the rows and columns that have been encountered so far.  For instance, after John 1:1-2, we could introduce the following table:

|  -    |  πρὸς   |
|-------|---------|
| ὁ θεός| πρὸς τὸν θεόν |
| ὁ Λόγος| πρὸς τὸν Λόγον |

At this point, however, we are not yet using words like "accusative", merely pointing out that πρὸς has this effect on each of these two-word phrases.

Treedowning is used later in the class to introduce concepts like subject, verb, object, etc.

## The passages

1. John 1:1-13 Logos
    1. Verses 1-2: Ἐν ἀρχῇ ἦν ὁ Λόγος, καὶ ὁ Λόγος ἦν πρὸς τὸν Θεόν, καὶ Θεὸς ἦν ὁ Λόγος. Οὗτος ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν Θεόν.
        1. Content Objective: Students will answer questions posted to them about the content of John 1:1-13 at least 4 out of 5 times.
        1. Language Objectives: 
            1. Using single-words or short phrases drawn from the text, students will respond appropriately in Greek to basic questions posed in Greek using ἢ (e.g. ἀρχῇ ἢ τελευτή; and τίς (e.g. τίς ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ;)
        1. Exposure:
            1. Students are exposed to the following skills, but not yet given enough practice to master them: questions using πρὸς τίνα (e.g. πρὸς τίνα ἦν ὁ λόγος ἐν ἀρχῇ;), questions using πότε (e.g. πότε ἦν ὁ λόγος πρὸς τὸν θεόν;), reading and writing the alphabet for letters used in the text, pronunciation of these words.
            1. Vocabulary, syntax, and grammatical forms will be tracked automatically for these lessons, and not called out under exposure (after this one mention).
        1. Sample questions
            1. ἀρχῇ ἢ τελευτή; τίς ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ; θεὸς ἢ ἄνθρωπος; τίς ἦν πρὸς τὸν θεόν; πρὸς τίνα ἦν ὁ λόγος; θεὸς ἦν ὁ λόγος ἢ ἄνθρωπος ἦν ὁ λόγος; τίς ἦν ἐν ἀρχῇ πρὸς τὸν θεόν; πρὸς τίνα ἦν ὁ λόγος ἐν ἀρχῇ; πότε ἦν ὁ λόγος πρὸς τὸν θεόν;
