1. Pick 10 passages - highlight big picture of life of Jesus
  - John 1:1
  - John 3
  - John 8
  - Mark 16
  ...
2. For each passage, do formatting along the lines in the templates directory
3. For each passage, pick a language objective and a content objective
4. For each passage, fill in scaffolding needed to allow students to answer each question. 
  - show text without explanation
  - add scaffolding 
  - work all 4 channels (work the handwriting channel)
  - rinse and repeat

Create both:  (a) student materials (possibly xhtml presentation, possibly PDF)
(b) teaching guide
